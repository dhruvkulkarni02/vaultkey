1. WHAT IS VAULTKEY?
--------------------
VaultKey is a password manager that:
‚Ä¢ Stores all your passwords securely
‚Ä¢ Encrypts them with military-grade encryption
‚Ä¢ Works completely offline (no internet needed)
‚Ä¢ Helps you create strong passwords
‚Ä¢ Makes logging in to websites easier


2. INSTALLATION
---------------
WINDOWS:
‚Ä¢ Copy the Windows folder to your computer
‚Ä¢ Double-click VaultKey.bat to start

MAC:
‚Ä¢ Copy the Mac folder to your computer  
‚Ä¢ Double-click VaultKey.command to start


3. FIRST TIME SETUP
-------------------
When you first start VaultKey:

a) You'll see a welcome screen with the VaultKey logo
b) Create your Master Password:
   ‚Ä¢ Make it at least 12 characters
   ‚Ä¢ Use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
   ‚Ä¢ Make it memorable but unique
   ‚Ä¢ Example: "MyDog$Buddy&Born2019!"
   ‚Ä¢ WRITE IT DOWN AND KEEP IT SAFE!
c) The program will create your encrypted vault


4. DAILY USE
------------
The Main Menu shows these options:

1. üîç Search Passwords - Find a saved password
2. ‚ûï Add Password - Save a new password  
3. üìã Browse Vault - See all passwords
4. üîê Quick Copy - Copy a password fast

ADDING A PASSWORD:
‚Ä¢ Press 2
‚Ä¢ Enter the website (e.g., "gmail.com")
‚Ä¢ Enter your username/email
‚Ä¢ Choose to generate a strong password (recommended!)
‚Ä¢ VaultKey saves it securely

GETTING A PASSWORD:
‚Ä¢ Press 4 for Quick Copy
‚Ä¢ Type part of the website name
‚Ä¢ Password is copied to clipboard
‚Ä¢ Just paste it where needed!


5. TIPS & BEST PRACTICES
------------------------
‚úì Always use generated passwords (they're stronger)
‚úì Give each account a unique password
‚úì Update passwords every few months
‚úì Never share your master password
‚úì Back up your vault file occasionally
‚úì Use the search feature - it's fast!


6. TROUBLESHOOTING
------------------
"Won't Open" (Windows):
‚Ä¢ Right-click VaultKey.bat ‚Üí Run as Administrator
‚Ä¢ Check if antivirus is blocking it
‚Ä¢ Try the PowerShell version instead

"Won't Open" (Mac):
‚Ä¢ Right-click ‚Üí Open (bypasses security warning)
‚Ä¢ Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Open Anyway
‚Ä¢ Make sure the file has execute permissions

"Forgot Master Password":
‚Ä¢ Unfortunately, it cannot be recovered
‚Ä¢ You'll need to start fresh with a new vault
‚Ä¢ This is what keeps your passwords secure!

"Can't Find a Password":
‚Ä¢ Try searching with just part of the name
‚Ä¢ Check if you typed it differently
‚Ä¢ Browse all passwords with option 3


7. SECURITY INFORMATION
-----------------------
‚Ä¢ Encryption: AES-256 (military-grade)
‚Ä¢ Your master password is NEVER stored
‚Ä¢ All data stays on YOUR computer
‚Ä¢ No internet connection required
‚Ä¢ Open source and auditable

Your passwords are safe with VaultKey!
